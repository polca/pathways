# ``pathways``

``pathways`` is a Python package that characterizes the
environmental impacts of products, sectors or transition scenarios 
over time using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).
Compared to traditional scenario results from energy models, 
``pathways`` provides a more detailed and transparent view of the
environmental impacts of a scenario by resolving supply chains
between producers and consumers (as an LCA does). Hence, direct
and indirect emissions are accounted for, and double-counting
issues are partially resolved. 

``pathways`` is initially designed to work with data packages produced
by ``premise``, but can be used with any IAM scenarios and LCA databases.

``pathways`` reads a scenario and a corresponding set of scenario-based LCA matrices
and calculates the environmental impacts of the scenario (or a subset of it) over time.

If you use ``pathways`` in a scientific publication, we would appreciate
citations to the following paper:

````
Sacchi et al., (2024). pathways: life cycle assessment of energy transition scenarios. Journal of Open Source Software, 9(103), 7309, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.07309

## Requirements

``pathways`` requires Python 3.10 or 3.11. It also requires the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

``pathways`` is in an early development stage, and
can be installed from the Github repo  with ``pip``:

```bash

  pip install git+https://github.com/polca/pathways.git

```

or alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it from the source:

```bash

    git clone https://github.com/polca/pathways.git
    cd pathways
    pip install .
    
```

``pathways`` is also available via anaconda:

```bash

    conda install -c conda-forge -c romainsacchi pathways

```

.. note:: If you use an ARM architecture, you may want to also install
    the `scikit-umfpack` package from the `conda-forge` channel for faster calculation.
    However, you need to make sure that `numpy<=1.24.4` is installed, as `bw2io` is not compatible 
    with the latest version of `numpy`:

```bash

    conda install -c conda-forge scikit-umfpack

```


## Usage

``pathways`` is a Python package, and can be used in Python scripts
or in a Python interpreter. 
See the [example notebook](https://github.com/polca/pathways/blob/main/example/example.ipynb).

### Python

To use the Pathways class, you need to provide it with a datapackage that contains your scenario data, mapping information, and LCA matrices.
The datapackage should be a zip file that contains the following files:

- `datapackage.json`: a JSON file that describes the contents of the datapackage
- a `mapping` folder containing a `mapping.yaml` file that describes the mapping between the IAM scenario and the LCA databases
- a `inventories` folder containing the LCA matrices as CSV files
- a `scenario_data` folder containing the IAM scenario data as CSV file

```python

from pathways import Pathways
datapackage_path = "path/to/your/datapackage.zip"
p = Pathways(
    datapackage=datapackage_path,
    debug=True # optional, if you want to see the logs
)

# Define your parameters (leave any as None to use all available values)
methods = ["IPCC 2021", "ReCiPe 2016"]
models = ["ModelA", "ModelB"]
scenarios = ["Baseline", "Intervention"]
regions = ["Region1", "Region2"]
years = [2020, 2025]
variables = ["Electricity", "Transport"]

# Run the calculation
p.calculate(
    methods=methods,
    models=models,
    scenarios=scenarios,
    regions=regions,
    years=years,
    variables=variables,
    use_distributions=0 # optional, if > 0: number of iterations for Monte Carlo analysis
)

```

The list of available LCIA methods can be obtained like so:

```python

    print(p.lcia_methods)

```


The argument `datapackage` is the path to the datapackage.zip file
that describes the scenario and the LCA databases -- see dev/sample.
The argument `methods` is a list of methods to be used for the LCA
calculations. The argument `years` is a list of years for which the
LCA calculations are performed. The argument `regions` is a list of
regions for which the LCA calculations are performed. The argument
`scenarios` is a list of scenarios for which the LCA calculations are
performed.

If not specified, all the methods, years, regions and scenarios
defined in the datapackage.json file are used, which can be very
time-consuming.

Once calculated, the results of the LCA calculations are stored in the `.lcia_results`
attribute of the `Pathways` object as an ``xarray.DataArray``. 

You can display the LCA results with an optional cutoff parameter to filter insignificant data:

```python

results = p.aggregate_results(cutoff=0.001)
print(results)

```

It can be further formatted  to a pandas' DataFrame or 
exported to a CSV/Excel file using the built-in methods of ``xarray``.
    
```python

    df = results.to_dataframe()
    df.to_csv("results.csv")

```

Or the result can be exported as a Parquet file for further use in `pandas` or `dask`:

```python

    p.export_results(filename="results.gzip")

```

Results can be visualized using your favorite plotting library.

Finally, when running a Monte Carlo analysis (i.e., when `use_distributions` is greater than 0), 
parameters of the Monte Carlo analysis (coordinates of uncertain exchanges, values for each iteration, etc.) are 
stored in Excel files. It is possible to run Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) on the results of the 
Monte Carlo analysis, like so:

```python

    from pathways import run_gsa
    run_gsa(method="delta")

```

The method argument can only be "delta" for now. It will run a 
Delta Moment-Independent Measure (DMIM) sensitivity analysis on the 
results of the Monte Carlo analysis, to rank the influence of each
uncertain exchange on the results' distribution.
